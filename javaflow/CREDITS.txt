This file is meant to provide the deserved visibility
for major efforts or donation to the javaflow project.

The initial idea of using bytecode transformation for
implementing a portable execution state serialization
and migration mechanism was borrowed from the discontinued
Brakes research project. The javaflow project would like
to thank the Brakes team for their efforts in this space.
