Must:
o testcases!!!!
o documentation of the rewriting process
o fix the maven build so the test suites run properly (some classloader issues)

Maybe:
o integrate just4log into the build system
o only wrap the function calls that may lead to a suspend (control flow analysis) requires 2-pass analysing/rewriting
o evaluate making the Stack class use a hierarchical approach to support differential continuations
o talk to the RIFE guys about joining forces
o talk to the aspectwerkz and aspectj folks about working together
