modified_super.py -> for microbenchmark in Parallel(p) or PipelinedParallel(pp) mode
pipelinedSequential_super.py -> for microbenchmark in sequential(s) or pipelinedSequential(ps) mode
super_script_tpcw.py -> for tpc-w benchmark. It can be used for p and pp mode because it currently uses corresponding classes
                     like ExecBaseNode and VerifierBaseNode. However, it does not modify the related parameters like first
                     two scripts so the parameters should be set properly in test.properties and test.properties.backend
sequential_super_tpcw.py -> for tpc-w benchmark. It can be used for s and ps mode because it currently uses corresponding classes
                     like OrderBaseNode. However, it does not modify the related parameters like first
                     two scripts so the parameters should be set properly in testSeq.properties and testSeq.properties.backend

basicRun.sh -> simple run in p mode from 1 client to 4 clients
compileAndBasicRun.sh -> compiles before simple run
sequentialBasicRun.sh -> simple run in s mode from 1 client to 4 clients
sequentialBasicRunCompile.sh -> compiles before simple sequential run
tpcwCompileAndRun.sh -> compiles before calling super_script_tpcw.py
