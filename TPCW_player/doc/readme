========== SQL Request Player ==========


===== Organization =====

request_player: some useful classes for both the statements_player and the functions_player.

request_player.local.ClientServer: the request player which embeds the server and the client in the same JVM.

request_player.remote.Server and request_player.remote.Client: the request player where the clients and the server are not necessarily on the same machine.

etc/requestPlayer.properties: this file contains the properties that have to be defined when launching the Request Player.
Another file can be used instead of the standard one (its name must be given as an argument when launching the program)


===== How to compile =====

Use ant and the build.xml file which is provided:
   $ ant build
Then you can create the jar file, which will be located in the bin/ directory:
   $ ant create-jar


===== How to launch =====

To launch the request player you can use the ant file.

There are two configurations: 
- you can run the DB and the TPCW client locally on the same machine. For that configuration, use: 
   * ant run-local
- you can run the DB and the TPCW client on different machines. For that configuration, use:
   * ant run-remote-server to launch the server (wait for the following line to be displayed: "Server is ready to accept connections...")
   * ant run-remote-client to launch the client
	

===== Configuring the properties file =====

1) By default, the used port is 4242 (as a reference to "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" answer to the Ultimate question of Life, the Universe and Everything, from Douglas Adams).

2) isolationLevel is (for now) only used with Derby.

3) There are 2 requests patterns: one with a new field containing either the SHOPPING_ID if any, or -1 otherwise.
To use the "old" pattern, set request_pattern_version to 0. Otherwise set it to 1.
