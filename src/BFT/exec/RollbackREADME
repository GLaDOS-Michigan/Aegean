Life Cycle of a Rollback

Should start with a verification message
1. In ExecBaseNode.java, the VerificationResponseMessage (from the verifiers?) is processed 
	You can see what the last requested verify was, 
	line 1314 in ExecBaseNode
Note that a rollback is needed
	If primary, and sense a divergence in digests - send a PBRollbackMessage
	Do we know that seqNo - 1 is the last stable/committed state? (line 1310)
Notify everyone that we're rolling back to last stable state? 

Rollback
	Grab stuff from Merkle - 
	MerkleTreeInstance.get().rollBack(glue.getMerkleTreeVersionLinkedWithRequestNo(startSeqNo));
	MerkleTree.rollBack() - what is happening? who knows

Execute all messages sequentially
	reExecute - method @ line 1373
	
Resume parallel execution - Not really a problem for pipebatch since reExecute never changes the mode of execution
