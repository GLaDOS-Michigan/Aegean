How to run the echo application.

1. Compile the code: From the base directory, simply launch ant. It creates
a "build" directory.
2. cd build
3. Create 4 one-line files, named "orders", "filters", "clients", and "execs".
The "filters" file is needed if during the configuration creation (see 4.) the
"insecure" option is set to false. Each file contains the line "localhost",
with no quotes.
4. Run (from the build dir):
java -cp ../simple_test/bft.jar:<other jar files in simple_test> \
	BFT.membership.MembershipGenerator
This interactively creates a configuration file ("test.properties" is the
default name).
5. Start the filter (if you chose insecure=false), then the order, then the
exec (the starting sequence between exec and order can be reversed), then the
client.
To run filter and order, do:
java -cp<as before> BFT.filter.FilterBaseNode <options>
java -cp<as before> BFT.order.OrderBaseNode <options>

To run server and client, do:
java -cp<see before> Applications.echo.EchoServer <options>
java -cp<see before> Applications.echo.EchoClient <options>

5. To run the C echo client, go in the corresponding dir
(BFT-c99/echo_client), do `make', then launch:
./testEchoClient
to get the usage help.
