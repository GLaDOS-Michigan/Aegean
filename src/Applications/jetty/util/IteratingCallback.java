/**
 * Iterating Callback.
 * <p>This specialized callback is used when breaking up an
 * asynchronous task into smaller asynchronous tasks.  A typical pattern
 * is that a successful callback is used to schedule the next sub task, but
 * if that task completes quickly and uses the calling thread to callback
 * the success notification, this can result in a growing stack depth.
 * </p>
 * <p>To avoid this issue, this callback uses an AtomicReference to note
 * if the success callback has been called during the processing of a
 * sub task, and if so then the processing iterates rather than recurses.
 * </p>
 * <p>This callback is passed to the asynchronous handling of each sub
 * task and a call the {@link #succeeded()} on this call back represents
 * completion of the subtask.  Only once all the subtasks are completed is
 * the {#completed()} method called.</p>
