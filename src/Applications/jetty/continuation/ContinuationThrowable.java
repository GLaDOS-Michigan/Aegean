/**
 * ContinuationThrowable
 * <p>
 * A ContinuationThrowable is throw by {@link Continuation#undispatch()}
 * in order to exit the dispatch to a Filter or Servlet.  Use of
 * ContinuationThrowable is discouraged and it is preferable to
 * allow return to be used. ContinuationThrowables should only be
 * used when there is a Filter/Servlet which cannot be modified
 * to avoid committing a response when {@link Continuation#isSuspended()}
 * is true.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * ContinuationThrowable instances are often reused so that the
 * stack trace may be entirely unrelated to the calling stack.
 * A real stack trace may be obtained by enabling debug.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * ContinuationThrowable extends Error as this is more likely
 * to be uncaught (or rethrown) by a Filter/Servlet.  A ContinuationThrowable
 * does not represent and error condition.
 * </p>
