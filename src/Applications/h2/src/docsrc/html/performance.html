                    In many cases H2 is faster than other
                    (open source and not open source) database engines.
                    Please note this is mostly a single connection benchmark run on one computer.

                <h3>Benchmark Results and Comments</h3>

                <h4>H2</h4>
                <p>
                    Version 1.1.114 (2009-06-01) was used for the test.
                    For simpler operations, the performance of H2 is about the same as for HSQLDB.
                    For more complex queries, the query optimizer is very important.
                    However H2 is not very fast in every case, certain kind of queries may still be slow.
                    One situation where is H2 is slow is large result sets, because they are buffered to
                    disk if more than a certain number of records are returned.
                    The advantage of buffering is, there is no limit on the result set size.
                    The open/close time is almost fixed, because of the file locking protocol: the engine waits
                    some time after opening a database to ensure the database files are not opened by another process.
                </p>

                <h4>HSQLDB</h4>
                <p>
                    Version 1.8.0.10 was used for the test.
                    Cached tables are used in this test (hsqldb.default_table_type=cached),
                    and the write delay is 1 second (<code>SET WRITE_DELAY 1</code>).
                    HSQLDB is fast when using simple operations.
                    HSQLDB is very slow in the last test (BenchC: Transactions), probably because is has a bad query
                    optimizer.
                    One query where HSQLDB is slow is a two-table join:
                </p>
                <pre>
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT S_I_ID) FROM ORDER_LINE, STOCK
WHERE OL_W_ID=? AND OL_D_ID=? AND OL_O_ID&lt;? AND OL_O_ID&gt;=?
AND S_W_ID=? AND S_I_ID=OL_I_ID AND S_QUANTITY&lt;?
</pre>
                <p>
                    The PolePosition benchmark also shows that the query optimizer does not do a very good job for some
                    queries.
                    Another disadvantage of HSQLDB is the slow startup / shutdown time (currently not listed) when using
                    bigger databases.
                    The reason is, a backup of the whole data is made whenever the database is opened or closed.
                </p>

                <h4>Derby</h4>
                <p>
                    Version 10.4.2.0 was used for the test. Derby is clearly the slowest embedded database in this test.
                    This seems to be a structural problem, because all operations are really slow.
                    It will be hard for the developers of Derby to improve the performance to a reasonable level.
                    A few problems have been identified: leaving autocommit on is a problem for Derby.
                    If it is switched off during the whole test, the results are about 20% better for Derby.
                    Derby supports a testing mode (system property <code>derby.system.durability=test</code>) where
                    durability is
                    disabled. According to the documentation, this setting should be used for testing only,
                    as the database may not recover after a crash. Enabling this setting improves performance
                    by a factor of 2.6 (embedded mode) or 1.4 (server mode). Even if enabled, Derby is still less
                    than half as fast as H2 in default mode.
                </p>

                <h4>PostgreSQL</h4>
                <p>
                    Version 8.3.7 was used for the test.
                    The following options where changed in <code>postgresql.conf:
                    fsync = off, commit_delay = 1000</code>.
                    PostgreSQL is run in server mode. It looks like the base performance is slower than
                    MySQL, the reason could be the network layer.
                    The memory usage number is incorrect, because only the memory usage of the JDBC driver is measured.
                </p>

                <h4>MySQL</h4>
                <p>
                    Version 5.1.34-community was used for the test.
                    MySQL was run with the InnoDB backend.
                    The setting <code>innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit</code>
                    (found in the <code>my.ini</code> file) was set to 0. Otherwise (and by default), MySQL is really
                    slow
                    (around 140 statements per second in this test) because it tries to flush the data to disk for each
                    commit.
                    For small transactions (when autocommit is on) this is really slow.
                    But many use cases use small or relatively small transactions.
                    Too bad this setting is not listed in the configuration wizard,
                    and it always overwritten when using the wizard.
                    You need to change this setting manually in the file <code>my.ini</code>, and then restart the
                    service.
                    The memory usage number is incorrect, because only the memory usage of the JDBC driver is measured.
                </p>

                <h4>Firebird</h4>
                <p>
                    Firebird 1.5 (default installation) was tested, but the results are not published currently.
                    It is possible to run the performance test with the Firebird database,
                    and any information on how to configure Firebird for higher performance are welcome.
                </p>

                <h4>Why Oracle / MS SQL Server / DB2 are Not Listed</h4>
                <p>
                    The license of these databases does not allow to publish benchmark results.
                    This doesn't mean that they are fast. They are in fact quite slow,
                    and need a lot of memory. But you will need to test this yourself.
                    SQLite was not tested because the JDBC driver doesn't support transactions.
                </p>

                <h3>About this Benchmark</h3>

                <h4>How to Run</h4>
                <p>
                    This test was executed as follows:
                </p>
                <pre>
build benchmark
</pre>

                <h4>Separate Process per Database</h4>
                <p>
                    For each database, a new process is started, to ensure the previous test does not impact
                    the current test.
                </p>

                <h4>Number of Connections</h4>
                <p>
                    This is mostly a single-connection benchmark.
                    BenchB uses multiple connections; the other tests use one connection.
                </p>

                <h4>Real-World Tests</h4>
                <p>
                    Good benchmarks emulate real-world use cases. This benchmark includes 4 test cases:
                    BenchSimple uses one table and many small updates / deletes.
                    BenchA is similar to the TPC-A test, but single connection / single threaded (see also:
                    www.tpc.org).
                    BenchB is similar to the TPC-B test, using multiple connections (one thread per connection).
                    BenchC is similar to the TPC-C test, but single connection / single threaded.
                </p>

                <h4>Comparing Embedded with Server Databases</h4>
                <p>
                    This is mainly a benchmark for embedded databases (where the application runs in the same
                    virtual machine as the database engine). However MySQL and PostgreSQL are not Java
                    databases and cannot be embedded into a Java application.
                    For the Java databases, both embedded and server modes are tested.
                </p>

                <h4>Test Platform</h4>
                <p>
                    This test is run on Windows XP with the virus scanner switched off.
                    The VM used is Sun JDK 1.5.
                </p>

                <h4>Multiple Runs</h4>
                <p>
                    When a Java benchmark is run first, the code is not fully compiled and
                    therefore runs slower than when running multiple times. A benchmark
                    should always run the same test multiple times and ignore the first run(s).
                    This benchmark runs three times, but only the last run is measured.
                </p>

                <h4>Memory Usage</h4>
                <p>
                    It is not enough to measure the time taken, the memory usage is important as well.
                    Performance can be improved by using a bigger cache, but the amount of memory is limited.
                    HSQLDB tables are kept fully in memory by default; this benchmark
                    uses 'disk based' tables for all databases.
                    Unfortunately, it is not so easy to calculate the memory usage of PostgreSQL
                    and MySQL, because they run in a different process than the test. This benchmark currently
                    does not print memory usage of those databases.
                </p>

                <h4>Delayed Operations</h4>
                <p>
                    Some databases delay some operations (for example flushing the buffers)
                    until after the benchmark is run. This benchmark waits between
                    each database tested, and each database runs in a different process (sequentially).
                </p>

                <h4>Transaction Commit / Durability</h4>
                <p>
                    Durability means transaction committed to the database will not be lost.
                    Some databases (for example MySQL) try to enforce this by default by
                    calling <code>fsync()</code> to flush the buffers, but
                    most hard drives don't actually flush all data. Calling the method slows down transaction commit a
                    lot,
                    but doesn't always make data durable. When comparing the results, it is important to
                    think about the effect. Many database suggest to 'batch' operations when possible.
                    This benchmark switches off autocommit when loading the data, and calls commit after each 1000
                    inserts. However many applications need 'short' transactions at runtime (a commit after each
                    update).
                    This benchmark commits after each update / delete in the simple benchmark, and after each
                    business transaction in the other benchmarks. For databases that support delayed commits,
                    a delay of one second is used.
                </p>

                <h4>Using Prepared Statements</h4>
                <p>
                    Wherever possible, the test cases use prepared statements.
                </p>

                <h4>Currently Not Tested: Startup Time</h4>
                <p>
                    The startup time of a database engine is important as well for embedded use.
                    This time is not measured currently.
                    Also, not tested is the time used to create a database and open an existing database.
                    Here, one (wrapper) connection is opened at the start,
                    and for each step a new connection is opened and then closed.

                    There are a few problems with the PolePosition test:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        HSQLDB uses in-memory tables by default while H2 uses persistent tables. The HSQLDB version
                        included in PolePosition does not support changing this, so you need to replace
                        <code>poleposition-0.20/lib/hsqldb.jar</code> with a newer version (for example
                        <code>hsqldb-1.8.0.7.jar</code>),
                        and then use the setting
                        <code>hsqldb.connecturl=jdbc:hsqldb:file:data/hsqldb/dbbench2;hsqldb.default_table_type=cached;sql.enforce_size=true</code>
                        in the file <code>Jdbc.properties</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>HSQLDB keeps the database open between tests, while H2 closes the database (losing all the
                        cache).
                        To change that, use the database URL <code>jdbc:h2:file:data/h2/dbbench;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>The amount of cache memory is quite important, specially for the PolePosition test.
                        Unfortunately, the PolePosition test does not take this into account.

                <h2 id="application_profiling">Application Profiling</h2>

                <h3>Analyze First</h3>
                <p>
                    Before trying to optimize performance, it is important to understand where the problem is (what part
                    of the application is slow).
                    Blind optimization or optimization based on guesses should be avoided, because usually it is not an
                    efficient strategy.
                    There are various ways to analyze an application. Sometimes two implementations can be compared
                    using
                    <code>System.currentTimeMillis()</code>. But this does not work for complex applications with many
                    modules, and for memory problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A simple way to profile an application is to use the built-in profiling tool of java. Example:
                </p>
                <pre>
java -Xrunhprof:cpu=samples,depth=16 com.acme.Test
</pre>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, it is only possible to profile the application from start to end. Another solution is
                    to create
                    a number of full thread dumps. To do that, first run <code>jps -l</code> to get the process id, and
                    then
                    run <code>jstack &lt;pid&gt;</code> or <code>kill -QUIT &lt;pid&gt;</code> (Linux) or press
                    Ctrl+C (Windows).
                </p>
                <p>
                    A simple profiling tool is included in H2. To use it, the application needs to be changed slightly.
                    Example:
                </p>
                <pre>
import org.h2.util;
...
profiler = new Profiler();
profiler.startCollecting();
// application code
profiler.stopCollecting();
System.out.println(profiler.getTop(3));
</pre>
                <p>
                    The profiler is built into the H2 Console tool, to analyze databases that open slowly.
                    To use it, run the H2 Console, and then click on 'Test Connection'.
                    Afterwards, click on "Test successful" and you get the most common stack traces,
                    which helps to find out why it took so long to connect. You will only get the stack traces
                    if opening the database took more than a few seconds.
                </p>

                <h2 id="database_profiling">Database Profiling</h2>
                <p>
                    The <code>ConvertTraceFile</code> tool generates SQL statement statistics at the end of the SQL
                    script file.
                    The format used is similar to the profiling data generated when using <code>java -Xrunhprof</code>.
                    As an example, execute the the following script using the H2 Console:
                </p>
                <pre>
SET TRACE_LEVEL_FILE 3;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS TEST;
CREATE TABLE TEST(ID INT PRIMARY KEY, NAME VARCHAR(255));
@LOOP 1000 INSERT INTO TEST VALUES(?, ?);
SET TRACE_LEVEL_FILE 0;
</pre>
                <p>
                    Now convert the <code>.trace.db</code> file using the <code>ConvertTraceFile</code> tool:
                </p>
                <pre>
java -cp h2*.jar org.h2.tools.ConvertTraceFile
    -traceFile "~/test.trace.db" -script "~/test.sql"
</pre>
                <p>
                    The generated file <code>test.sql</code> will contain the SQL statements as well as the
                    following profiling data (results vary):
                </p>
                <pre>

                <h3>Keep Connections Open or Use a Connection Pool</h3>
                <p>
                    If your application opens and closes connections a lot (for example, for each request),
                    you should consider using a <a href="tutorial.html#connection_pool">connection pool</a>.
                    Opening a connection using <code>DriverManager.getConnection</code> is specially slow
                    if the database is closed. By default the database is closed if the last connection is closed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you open and close connections a lot but don't want to use a connection pool,
                    consider keeping a 'sentinel' connection open for as long as the application runs,
                    or use delayed database closing. See also
                    <a href="features.html#closing_a_database">Closing a database</a>.
                </p>

                <h3>Use a Modern JVM</h3>
                <p>
                    Newer JVMs are faster. Upgrading to the latest version of your JVM can provide a "free" boost to
                    performance.
                    Switching from the default Client JVM to the Server JVM using the <code>-server</code> command-line
                    option improves performance at the cost of a slight increase in start-up time.
                </p>

                <h3>Virus Scanners</h3>
                <p>
                    Some virus scanners scan files every time they are accessed.
                    It is very important for performance that database files are not scanned for viruses.
                    The database engine never interprets the data stored in the files as programs,
                    that means even if somebody would store a virus in a database file, this would
                    be harmless (when the virus does not run, it cannot spread).
                    Some virus scanners allow to exclude files by suffix. Ensure files ending with <code>.db</code> are
                    not scanned.
                </p>

                <h3>Using the Trace Options</h3>
                <p>
                    If the performance hot spots are in the database engine, in many cases the performance
                    can be optimized by creating additional indexes, or changing the schema. Sometimes the
                    application does not directly generate the SQL statements, for example if an O/R mapping tool
                    is used. To view the SQL statements and JDBC API calls, you can use the trace options.
                    For more information, see <a href="features.html#trace_options">Using the Trace Options</a>.
                </p>

                <h3>Index Usage</h3>
                <p>
                    This database uses indexes to improve the performance of
                    <code>SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE</code>.
                    If a column is used in the <code>WHERE</code> clause of a query, and if an index exists on this
                    column,
                    then the index can be used. Multi-column indexes are used if all or the first columns of the index
                    are used.
                    Both equality lookup and range scans are supported.
                    Indexes are used to order result sets, but only if the condition uses the same index or no index at
                    all.
                    The results are sorted in memory if required.
                    Indexes are created automatically for primary key and unique constraints.
                    Indexes are also created for foreign key constraints, if required.
                    For other columns, indexes need to be created manually using the <code>CREATE INDEX</code>
                    statement.
                </p>

                <h3>Optimizer</h3>
                <p>
                    This database uses a cost based optimizer. For simple and queries and queries with medium complexity
                    (less than 7 tables in the join), the expected cost (running time) of all possible plans is
                    calculated,
                    and the plan with the lowest cost is used. For more complex queries, the algorithm first tries
                    all possible combinations for the first few tables, and the remaining tables added using a greedy
                    algorithm
                    (this works well for most joins). Afterwards a genetic algorithm is used to test at most 2000
                    distinct plans.
                    Only left-deep plans are evaluated.
                </p>

                <h3>Expression Optimization</h3>
                <p>
                    After the statement is parsed, all expressions are simplified automatically if possible. Operations
                    are evaluated only once if all parameters are constant. Functions are also optimized, but only
                    if the function is constant (always returns the same result for the same parameter values).
                    If the <code>WHERE</code> clause is always false, then the table is not accessed at all.
                </p>

                <h3>COUNT(*) Optimization</h3>
                <p>
                    If the query only counts all rows of a table, then the data is not accessed.
                    However, this is only possible if no <code>WHERE</code> clause is used, that means it only works for
                    queries of the form <code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table</code>.
                </p>

                <h3>Updating Optimizer Statistics / Column Selectivity</h3>
                <p>
                    When executing a query, at most one index per joined table can be used.
                    If the same table is joined multiple times, for each join only one index is used.
                    Example: for the query
                    <code>SELECT * FROM TEST T1, TEST T2 WHERE T1.NAME='A' AND T2.ID=T1.ID</code>,
                    two index can be used, in this case the index on NAME for T1 and the index on ID for T2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a table has multiple indexes, sometimes more than one index could be used.
                    Example: if there is a table <code>TEST(ID, NAME, FIRSTNAME)</code> and an index on each column,
                    then two indexes could be used for the query <code>SELECT * FROM TEST WHERE NAME='A' AND
                    FIRSTNAME='B'</code>,
                    the index on NAME or the index on FIRSTNAME. It is not possible to use both indexes at the same
                    time.
                    Which index is used depends on the selectivity of the column. The selectivity describes the
                    'uniqueness' of
                    values in a column. A selectivity of 100 means each value appears only once, and a selectivity of 1
                    means
                    the same value appears in many or most rows. For the query above, the index on NAME should be used
                    if the table contains more distinct names than first names.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The SQL statement <code>ANALYZE</code> can be used to automatically estimate the selectivity of the
                    columns in the tables.
                    This command should be run from time to time to improve the query plans generated by the optimizer.
                </p>

                <h3>In-Memory (Hash) Indexes</h3>
                <p>
                    Using in-memory indexes, specially in-memory hash indexes, can speed up
                    queries and data manipulation.
                </p>
                <p>In-memory indexes are automatically used
                    for in-memory databases, but can also be created for persistent databases
                    using <code>CREATE MEMORY TABLE</code>. In many cases,
                    the rows itself will also be kept in-memory. Please note this may cause memory
                    problems for large tables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In-memory hash indexes are backed by a hash table and are usually faster than
                    regular indexes. However, hash indexes only supports direct lookup (<code>WHERE ID = ?</code>)
                    but not range scan (<code>WHERE ID &lt; ?</code>). To use hash indexes, use HASH as in:
                    <code>CREATE UNIQUE HASH INDEX</code> and
                    <code>CREATE TABLE ...(ID INT PRIMARY KEY HASH,...)</code>.
                </p>

                <h3>Optimization Examples</h3>
                <p>
                    See <code>src/test/org/h2/samples/optimizations.sql</code> for a few examples of queries
                    that benefit from special optimizations built into the database.
                </p>

                <h3>Cache Size and Type</h3>
                <p>
                    By default the cache size of H2 is quite small. Consider using a larger cache size, or enable
                    the second level soft reference cache. See also <a href="features.html#cache_settings">Cache
                    Settings</a>.
                </p>

                <h3>Data Types</h3>
                <p>
                    Each data type has different storage and performance characteristics:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <code>DECIMAL/NUMERIC</code> type is slower
                        and requires more storage than the <code>REAL</code> and <code>DOUBLE</code> types.
                    </li>
                    <li>Text types are slower to read, write, and compare than numeric types and generally require more
                        storage.
                    </li>
                    <li>See <a href="advanced.html#large_objects">Large Objects</a> for information on
                        <code>BINARY</code> vs. <code>BLOB</code>
                        and <code>VARCHAR</code> vs. <code>CLOB</code> performance.
                    </li>
                    <li>Parsing and formatting takes longer for the
                        <code>TIME</code>, <code>DATE</code>, and
                        <code>TIMESTAMP</code> types than the numeric types.
                    </li>
                    <li><code>SMALLINT/TINYINT/BOOLEAN</code> are not significantly smaller or faster
                        to work with than <code>INTEGER</code> in most modes.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Sorted Insert Optimization</h3>
                <p>
                    To reduce disk space usage and speed up table creation, an
                    optimization for sorted inserts is available. When used, b-tree pages
                    are split at the insertion point. To use this optimization, add <code>SORTED</code>
                    before the <code>SELECT</code> statement:
                </p>
                <pre>
CREATE TABLE TEST(ID INT PRIMARY KEY, NAME VARCHAR) AS
    SORTED SELECT X, SPACE(100) FROM SYSTEM_RANGE(1, 100);
INSERT INTO TEST
    SORTED SELECT X, SPACE(100) FROM SYSTEM_RANGE(101, 200);
</pre>

                <h2 id="built_in_profiler">Using the Built-In Profiler</h2>
                <p>
                    A very simple Java profiler is built-in. To use it, use the following template:
                </p>
                <pre>
import org.h2.util.Profiler;
Profiler prof = new Profiler();
prof.startCollecting();
// .... some long running process, at least a few seconds
prof.stopCollecting();
System.out.println(prof.getTop(3));
</pre>

                <h2 id="fast_import">Fast Database Import</h2>
                <p>
                    To speed up large imports, consider using the following options temporarily:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>SET CACHE_SIZE</code> (a large cache is faster)
                    </li>
                    <li><code>SET LOCK_MODE 0</code> (disable locking)
                    </li>
                    <li><code>SET LOG 0</code> (disable the transaction log)
                    </li>
                    <li><code>SET UNDO_LOG 0</code> (disable the session undo log)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These options can be set in the database URL:
                    <code>jdbc:h2:~/test;CACHE_SIZE=65536;LOCK_MODE=0;LOG=0;UNDO_LOG=0</code>.
                    Most of those options are not recommended for regular use, that means you need to reset them after
                    use.
                </p>
