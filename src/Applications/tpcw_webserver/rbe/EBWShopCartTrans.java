 *
 * TPC-W shopping cart transition.  Requests the shopping cart page,
 *  and sends CID and shopping ID if known.  Sends ADD_FLAG, and
 *  possibly I_ID (comma separated list of item IDs, and QTY (comma
 *  separated list of item quantities).
 *  
 * NOTE:  The TPC-W Spec (Clause 2.4) talks alot about (I_ID, QTY) pairs.
 *  However, the I_ID (book item ID) is not supplied by the SUT in the
 *  Shopping cart page HTML.  Therefore the EB does not know the I_IDs.
 *
 * Looking at the suggested HTML, it is apparent that the EB does *not*
 *  ever supply I_IDs to the SUT when the add flag = 'N'.  The EB merely
 *  supplies a string of QTYs, in the same order as recieved.  The SUT
 *  must determine the I_IDs from the order of the QTYs, based on 
 *  the SCL_I_IDs in the shopping cart.  This mainly has to do with
 *  the refersh transition from the shopping cart page to the shopping
 *  cart page.
 *  
 * The only time ADD_FLAG=Y, is the <add to cart> transition from the
 *  product detail page to the shopping cart page.  In this case, the
 *  EB must supply the I_ID for the new item to be added.  Fortunatly
 *  the product detail HTML has the I_ID embedded in it in the form
 *  "BookID=<I_ID>".
 *
 * In summary, the shopping cart transition has three forms:
 *
 * ADD_FLAG = N, no QTYs or I_IDs.  From Home, Search Request, New Products
 *   Best Seller, Search Result, Buy Request.
 *  
 *   SUT just displays the current status of the cart.  Creates one if
 *    needed.  Adds a random item to it.
 *
 *   This class (EBWShopCartTrans) handles this case.
 *
 * ADD_FLAG = N, same number of QTYs as previously, randomly modified.
 *   From Shopping Cart.  SUT updates the cart with the new quantities.
 *
 *   EBWShopCartRefTrans handles this case.
 *
 * ADD_FLAG = Y, QTY = #, I_ID = BookID.  From Product Detail.
 *   SUT adds the new item to the cart.
 *
 *   EBWShopCartAddTrans handles this case.
